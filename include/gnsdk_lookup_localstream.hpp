		/**
		 * Provides services for local lookup of MusicID-Stream queries
		 *
		 * GnLookupLocalStream is a MusicID-Stream local lookup provider, providing a local
		 * database of MusicID-Stream tracks suitable for lookup via GnMusicIdStream or GnMusicId.
		 *
		 * The local database is a Gracenote storage; therefore a storage provider, such as GnStorageSqlite,
		 * must be enabled as a pre-requisite to successfully using this class.
		 *
		 * <b>Bundle Ingestion</b>
		 *
		 * The MusicID-Stream local database is constructed from "bundles" provided periodically by Gracenote.
		 * Your application must ingest the bundle, a process that adds the tracks from the bundle to the local
		 * database making them available for local recognition.
		 *
		 * To ingest a bundle create an instance of GnLookupLocalStreamIngest and write the bundle bytes
		 * as received when streaming the bundle from your online service.
		 *
		 * Multiple bundles can be ingested by the same application. If the same track exists in multiple
		 * ingested bundles it is added to the local database only once and only the most recent/up-to-date track
		 * information is written to the database.
		 *
		 * The process of ingestion can be lengthy. Some applications may wish to perform ingestion on a
		 * background thread to avoid stalling the main application thread.
		 *
		 * <b>Bundle Management</b>
		 *
		 * Bundles are regularly generated for multiple global regions and in multiple flavors being
		 * incremental (only differences from previous bundle for that region) or full (all records for the
		 * region).
		 *
		 * Incremental bundles are intended for applications that have installed the previous bundles in the
		 * sequence. If your application skips a bundle it should clear it's MusicID-Stream local database
		 * and install the full bundle.
		 *
		 * Your bundle management system must provide the means to regularly distribute the correct bundle to
		 * your application, ensuring it provides the bundle for the correct region and, as appropriate, the
		 * full or incremental bundle.
		 *
		 * A typical bundle management system is:<br>
		 * - retrieve bundles as produced by Gracenote (manual step)<br>
		 * - place bundle in online location where application can fetch it<br>
		 * - application downloads and ingests the bundle
		 *
		 * Note: Bundles should be retrieved from an online source. Gracenote recommends when your application
		 * is installed/initialized it download and ingest the latest bundle rather than ship with a bundle as
		 * part of the application binaries.
