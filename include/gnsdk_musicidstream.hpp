		/**
		 * Identifies raw audio received in a continuous stream.
		 *
		 * GnMusicIdStream provides services for identifying music within a continuous audio stream.
		 * As data is received from the audio stream it is provided to GnMusicIdStream, when the application
		 * wishes to identify the audio it initializes an identification. The results of the identification
		 * are delivered asynchronously to a delegate object.
		 *
		 * GnMusicIdStream is a long-life object and, for a single audio stream, a single instance should
		 * be kept for as long as the application wishes to identify that audio stream. Where multiple audio
		 * streams require identification multiple instances of GnMusicIdStream are also required.
		 *
		 * GnMusicIdStream can be started and stopped as the audio stream starts and stops. There is no need
		 * to destroy and recreate a GnMusicIdStream instance due to breaks in the audio stream.
		 *
		 * <b>Audio Processing</b>
		 *
		 * After instantiating a GnMusicIdStream object the next step is to start audio processing and provide
		 * raw audio. Raw audio can be provided automatically or manually.
		 *
		 * To provide audio automatically your audio stream must be represented by an object that implements
		 * IGnAudioSource interface. Gracenote provides GnMic class on some platforms which is a representation
		 * of the device microphone, though you are encouraged to provide custom implementations representing
		 * any audio stream source your application needs.
		 *
		 * Internally GnMusicIdStream pulls data from the audio source interface in a loop, so some applications
		 * may wish to start automatic audio processing in a background thread to avoid stalling the main thread.
		 *
		 * Raw audio can also be manually provided to GnMusicIdStream. Audio processing must be started and the
		 * audio format provided, this allows GnMusicIdStream to establish internal buffers and audio
		 * processing modules. Once audio processing is started audio can then be written for processing as
		 * it is received from the stream.
		 *
		 * At any point audio processing can be stopped. When stopped automatic data fetching ceases or
		 * if audio data is being provided manually attempts to write data for processing
		 * manually will fail. Internally GnMusicIdStream clears and releases all buffers and audio
		 * processing modules. Audio processing can be restarted after it is stopped.
		 *
		 * If an error occurs during manual audio processing an exception is thrown during the audio write API
		 * call. If an error occurs during automatic audio processing the internal loop is exited and an exception
		 * thrown from the audio processing start API.
		 *
		 * <b>Identification</b>
		 *
		 * At any point the application can trigger an identification of the audio stream. The identification
		 * process identifies buffered audio. Only up to ~7 seconds of the most recent audio is buffered.
		 * If there isn't enough audio buffered for identification it will wait until enough audio is received.
		 *
		 * The identification process spawns a thread and completes asynchronously. However two identify methods
		 * are provided, one for synchronous and one for asynchronous. Where synchronous identification is invoked the
		 * identification is still performed asynchronously and results delivered via delegate implementing
		 * IGnMusicIdStreamEvents, but the identify method does not return until the identification is complete.
		 * Requests to identify audio while a previous pending identification request is pending will be ignored.
		 *
		 * Audio can be identified against Gracenote's online database or a local database. The default
		 * behavior is to attempt a match against the local database and if a match isn't found try the
		 * online database. Local matches are only possible if GnLookupLocalStream object has been
		 * instantiated and a MusicID-Stream fingerprint bundle ingested. See GnLookupLocalStream for
		 * more information on bundle ingestion.
		 *
		 * An identification process can be canceled. In this case the identification
		 * process stops and, if synchronous identification was invoked, the identify method returns.
		 * The identify error delegate method will be called with an "aborted" error when cancelled.
		 * Note cancelling does not cease audio processing and application can invoke identify again after
		 * cancelling.
		 *
		 * If an error occurs during identification it is reported in one of two ways.
		 * If the error occurs in the asynchronous identifying thread the error information is provided
		 * via identifying error delegate method and the result available delegate method will not be called.
		 * Where this delegate method is invoked no result available delegate method is invoked.
		 * If the error occurs prior to the asynchronous identifying thread being launched an exception
		 * is thrown from the identifying API.
		 *
		 * <b>Configuration</b>
		 *
		 * GnMusicIdStream is configurable via it's options object. The configuration determines, among
		 * other things, if identification is performed against local database, online database or both;
		 * the content returned with results (images, external IDs, etc.)
		 * See GnMusicIdStreamOptions for more information.
		 *
		 *
		 * Note: Customers must be licensed to implement use of a MusicID product in an application.
		 * Contact your Gracenote support representative with questions about product licensing and
		 * entitlement.
