		 *
		 *  Expired records are those older than the maximum allowable, even if the record has been recently
		 *  read. Old but actively read records are removed because Gracenote Service may have an updated

		 *
		 *  The maximum allowable age of a record varies by query type and is managed internally by
		 *  Gracenote. Applications can use GnUser option to adjust the age at which
