		/**
		 *  \class GnMusicId
		 *  Provides services for audio recognition using CD TOC-based search,
		 *  text-based search, fingerprint, and identifier lookup functionality.
		 *
		 *  GnMusicId is a one-shot object, meaning it's life time is scoped to a single
		 *  recognition event and your application should create a new one for each
		 *  recognition.
		 *
		 *  Recognition can be performed with various inputs, including text inputs, for
		 *  a text search; identifiers, to retrieve a response for a known Gracenote database
		 *  record; plus others.
		 *
		 *  Recognitions can also be targeted or generic. A targeted
		 *  search for only albums can be invoked via any FindAlbums methods, while a
		 *  generic search can be performed using any FindMatches method.
		 *
		 *  During a recognition event status events can be received via a delegate object
		 *  that implements IGnStatusEvents.
		 *
		 *  A recognition event can be cancelled by the GnMusicId cancel method or by the
		 *  "canceller" provided in each events delegate method.
		 *
		 *  GnMusicId recognition events are performed synchronously, with the response object
		 *  returned to your application.
		 *
		 *  GnMusicId can also generate fingerprint data from raw audio. Generating fingerprints
		 *  is preferred when a device cannot immediately perform recognition, perhaps because it
		 *  is temporarily disconnected from the Internet, and wishes to do so later. Fingerprint
		 *  data is much smaller that raw audio, putting less demand on storage resources.
		 *
		 *  GnMusicId is configurable via it's options object. See GnMusicIdOptions for more
		 *  information.
		 *
		 *  Note: Customers must be licensed to implement use of a MusicID product in an application.
		 *  Contact your Gracenote support representative with questions about product licensing and
		 *  entitlement.
